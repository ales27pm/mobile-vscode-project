# AGENT Instructions

This repository contains a mobile IDE built with GraphQL, Y.js, and React Native. Contributions should follow these guidelines:

- Install dependencies with `yarn install`.
- Run the GraphQL code generator with `yarn codegen` if GraphQL schema or operations change.
- Lint the code with `yarn lint` and run tests via `yarn test` before committing.
- Build the backend with `yarn workspace backend build` when necessary.

Commits should be concise and use the imperative mood. New code should be written in TypeScript.
