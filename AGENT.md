# AGENT Instructions

This repository contains a mobile IDE built with GraphQL, Y.js, and React Native. The backend runs as a VS Code extension, exposing the local VS Code environment to the mobile frontend.

-   Install dependencies with `yarn install`.
-   Run the GraphQL code generator with `yarn codegen` if the GraphQL schema or operations change.
-   Lint the code with `yarn lint` and run tests via `yarn test` before committing.
-   To develop the extension, open this project in VS Code and press `F5` to launch the **Extension Development Host**.
-   Inside the new VS Code window, run the command "Start Mobile VSCode Server".

Commits should be concise and use the imperative mood. New code should be written in TypeScript.
